                <h1>Dog Facts</h1>
                <p>The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in
                    Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this
                    dog was not a local wolf.[20] The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with
                    a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large,
                    thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine distemper.[21] Earlier remains dating back to 30,000
                    years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains
                    debated[22] because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late
                    Pleistocene.[1]</p>
                <p>This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated[9][8] in the time of
                    hunterâ€“gatherers,[7] which predates agriculture.[1] DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern
                    dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was
                    distinct from the modern wolf lineage</p>
                <p>The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into
                    domestication.[22][23] The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed
                    geneticists and archaeologists for decades.[9] Genetic studies suggest a domestication process
                    commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high
                    Arctic, or eastern Asia.[10] In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the
                    dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed
                    eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia,[20] with dogs likely accompanying the first
                    humans to inhabit the Americas</p>
